# Sessions and Session Management

![sessionman](img/sessionmanagement.png)

Use Sessions to track the state of a user's interactions with your application across multiple requests, over a specified period of time.  Tracking user state with Sessions enables more feature-rich user experiences.  Further, Sessions play a major role in access control.

Session Management involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting of Sessions and Session attributes, and validating Sessions.

Yosai's `SessionManager` uses a `CachingSessionStore` to cache sessions. If you are not caching sessions, you are either using in-memory session storage  (the `MemorySessionStore`) or using your own custom SessionStore, which is beyond the scope of consideration in this documentation.


## Authentication, Authorization, and Session Management are Related

Access is limited by user identity: a guest cannot perform the operations that an authenticated user can, and each authenticated user may perform different operations.

The identity of an authenticated user is recorded in the Session.

Since access control is limited by identity, and identity is obtained from a Session, access control is considered *bound* to a Session.


## Properties of a Session , Session Risk, and Risk Countermeasures

Sessions are a "threat vector":  a path that an "actor" may exploit to attack a "target" (your application).  Sessions are exploited by a process known as hijacking.  Session Management helps to manage many of the inherent risks of Sessions through a series of countermeasures.  More information about these countermeasures follows in the documentation.


### The Session Token

A Session Token is like a smart chip, or magnetic strip, on a credit card in that it contains identification-- a session identifier (SessionID).  However, unlike the elements of a credit card, the Session Token has a much shorter lifespan.

The `SessionID` is a sensitive and critical piece of information.  It uniquely identifies a Session.  It is the Session's key in a SessionStore (cache) and it is the key that is sent with subsequent requests by a client (the user).

Once an authenticated session is established, the `SessionID` is the client's key to Yosai.  Therefore, it is very important that the session identifier be unique and very difficult to reproduce.  

Yosai's default method to generate a `SessionID` is as follows:
`sha256(sha512(urandom(20)).digest()).hexdigest()`


### Temporal Risks and Countermeasures

The risk of compromising a Session increases as time passes.  To address time-driven risks, Yosai defines temporal properties in a Session -- idle time and maximum allowable time to live (TTL) -- that enable "timing out" of Sessions.

When a Session "times out", it is considered **expired**.  When a Session is **expired**, it can no longer be used in Yosai, and therefore is no longer at risk of being hijacked.

The timeout thresholds are configured in the Yosai settings YAML file. Should you find their default settings unacceptable, you can easily change them.  The default settings are somewhat aggressive so as to minimize the risks that defaults may present and to encourage developers to take ownership of session time-out decisions.


### Idle time

![idle_timeout](img/idle.png)

This property represents the total permissible time for a user to be inactive in a system, or idle.  Picture idle timeout as an hourglass that is turned over and reset periodically. The way that idle time is reset is by updating the Session's `last_access_time` attribute.  As to when the `last_access_time` is updated depends on what "auto_touch" has been configured to or whether you've chosen an alternative time to touch than the default (per-access).

A `DefaultNativeSessionManager` has an attribute, "auto_touch", that when set to True will allow the updating of a Session's `last_access_time` attribute to the current time, whenever a session is accessed, following Session validation. As mentioned, when a Session should be touched depends on the type of application you are developing and thus auto_touch is a configurable feature.  When a Session is obtained from the SessionStore, it is immediately validated.  Should the validation not raise any exceptions, and if auto_touch is True, the Session will be "touched".  Touching a Session is the process of flipping and resetting the hourglass, so to speak, by updating the `last_access_time` attribute of the Session.

Yosai's default idle time setting for a Session is **5 minutes**.


### Time to live

![ttl](img/ttl.png)

A Session has a maximum allowable time period that it may exist.  It is the final countdown until a Session is expired. It cannot be reset, unlike idle timeout. Many computer systems refer to this as a TTL -- time to live.  Yosai's default time-to-live for a Session is **30 minutes**.


### Stopping Sessions

Aside from expirations, another mechanism for rendering Sessions useless in is **stopping** them.  When a subject logs out of a system, the subject's Session is stopped.  Like an expired Session, a **stopped** Session can no longer be used and is consequently no longer at risk of being hijacked.


### Session Validation

Session Validation is the process of determining whether a Session has stopped or expired.  When a session has stopped or expired, it is considered **invalid**.

A Session expires when the time duration between the current time and the last recorded time that a Session was accessed exceeds either timeout threshold.

Keeping track of idle expiration presents performance challenges.  Therefore, Sessions are validated _only_ when they are accessed (i.e. subject.get_session()).

the last_access_timestamp synchronized with session usage presents a

if the duration between the last_access_timestamp and the current time exceeds either timeout threshold, a session is considered expired

By default, Sessions are "lazy validated" in that they are validated at the time that [they are accessed?].

As discussed in an earlier section above, access control is _bound_ to a Session. Since access control is _bound_ to a Session, when a Session is invalidated so too does the authorization information cached for the Session.  Invalid authorization information is cleared from cache through event handling.


### Idle Timeout Edge Case
Monitoring for idle timeout increases the complexity of Session Management.
As discussed, Session validation taxes the performance of an application and
therefore does not run before every authorization check.  Instead, validation
is designed to maximize utility for the most popular use case-- one where the
subject instance has a short life span in memory and sessions validate when
they are accessed.

Therefore, it is recommended that you release a Subject instance for garbage
collection between requests.


## The Session Synchronization Design Challenge

Keeping the last_access_timestamp synchronized with session usage presents a performance design challenge that you are encouraged to help improve.  Ideas are welcome!


## Session Invalidation

By default, whenever Yosai detects an invalid session, it attempts to delete it from the underlying session data store via the SessionStore.delete(session) method.  However, should you decide not to automatically delete invalid sessions, you can easily opt-out of this process.  For example, if your application uses a SessionStore that backs a queryable data store, perhaps your dev team wants old or invalid sessions to be available for a certain period of time. Storing invalid sessions would allow you to run queries against the data store to see, for example, how many sessions a user has created over the last week, or the average duration of a user's sessions, or similar reporting-type queries.

At Session expiration, Yosai ties up loose ends, so to speak, through its event-driven architecture.


## Session Usage


### Session Initialization

A Session can be used to manage state for a Subject regardless of whether the Subject has authenticated itself or remains anonymous.  Yosai initializes a server-side Session when a Subject is instantiated and it's get_session() is called for anonymous guest sessions or at successful authentication.

```Python
from yosai.core import SecurityUtils, UsernamePasswordToken

# creates an "anonymous session" if the current executing subject hasn't
# logged in yet:
guest = SecurityUtils.subject
subject.get_session()
```

You can then manage state as necessary using the session, but more about that later: .. code-block:: python     session = guest.get_session()  # returns an anonymous session (guest)

After a user authenticates itself, Yosai creates a new session for the user. This is done for a few reasons.  The user's access to the system changes as the user's identity changes (from anonymous to authenticated).  A new, "authenticated session" replaces the "anonymous session" the moment that a subject is authenticated as a user:

```Python
from yosai.core import SecurityUtils, UsernamePasswordToken

# creates an "anonymous session" if the current executing subject hasn't
# logged in yet:
current_user = SecurityUtils.get_subject()

authc_token = UsernamePasswordToken(username='thedude',
                                    credentials='letsgobowling')

# creates an "authenticated session" if login in successful, raising
# an exception otherwise (try/except left out to simplify the example):
current_user.login(authc_token)
```

!!! note ""
    It is recommended that the session be regenerated by the application after     **any** privilege level change within the associated user session.


## Session Storage

Whenever a Session is created or updated, its data is persisted to a storage location so that it may be accessible by the application at a later time. Similarly, when a Session is invalid and longer being used, it is deleted from storage so that the Session data store space is not exhausted (if you're not taking advantage of TTL expiration in your data store).

The SessionManager implementations delegate these Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) operations to an internal component, the SessionStore, which reflects the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern.

The power of the SessionStore is that you can implement this interface to communicate with any data store you wish. This means your session data can reside in memory, on the file system, in a relational database or NoSQL data store, or any other location you want. You have control over persistence behavior.

Yosai features an in-memory MemorySessionStore and CachingSessionStore.  The CachingSessionStore is the default, and recommended, SessionStore for Yosai.


## Session Events

An Event is emitted to the singleton EventBus, in Yosai, when a Session is _started_, _stopped_, or _expired_.  If you would like to learn more about Event processing, please refer to the documentation about Event Processing.

Events are communicated using a publish-subscribe paradigm.  In the case of Sessions, a `SessionEventHandler` publishes an event to a channel (an internal Event Bus). The EventBus relays an event to consumers who have subscribed to the event's topic. It relays the event by calling the callback method registered for a consumer, using the event payload as its argument(s).

The following table lists the Session-related events and who the subscriber(s) are:

Event Topic    | Subscriber(s)
-------------- | -------------
SESSION.START  | EL           
SESSION.STOP   | MRA, EL      
SESSION.EXPIRE | MRA, EL      

- MRA = `yosai.core.authz.authz.ModularRealmAuthorizer`
- SEH = `yosai.core.session.session.SessionEventHandler`


### Example:  SESSION.EXPIRE Event Processing

At Yosai initialization, `yosai.core.authz.authz.ModularRealmAuthorizer` subscribes to a few event topics, one of which is 'SESSION.EXPIRE'. When it subscribes to the 'SESSION.EXPIRE' topic, it registers a callback method, `session_clears_cache`.  This callback method is called by the EventBus whenever a 'SESSION.EXPIRE' event is emitted to the bus.

A `SESSION.EXPIRE` event is emitted by a `yosai.core.session.session.SessionEventHandler` when Session Validation has recognized a Session as expired.

As of yosai.core v0.1.0, the `ModularRealmAuthorizer` and `EventLogger` are the two subscribers of the `SESSION.EXPIRE` topic (see table above).  The callback method registered for each subscriber is called in an arbitrary, sequential fasion (PyPubSub design) when a SessionEventHandler emits a SESSION.EXPIRE event to the Eventbus.

Here is an example of an `expired-session` event processing through Yosai, omitting event logging processing:

# Session Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Session API to perform server-side session management.  We'll use a shopping cart example to illustrate how to manage state using a Session object.  You will learn how to:     1) define a `marshmallow` Schema required to cache a shopping cart as        a Session attribute     2) manage a shopping cart using the Session API, including:
- get_attribute
- set_attribute
- remove_attribute


## Serialization Strategy

This example uses Session caching.  Objects are serialized before they are cached.

Yosai uses the `marshmallow` library in conjunction with an encoding library, such as MSGPack or JSON, to (de)serialize Serializable objects from(to) cache. `marshmallow` requires you to specify the Schema of the object and how to properly (de)serialize it.  A Session is a Serializable object, therefore it requires its own `marshmallow.Schema` definition.

Only `Serializable` objects can be serialized in Yosai.  A Serializable class implements the serialize_abcs.Serializable abstract base class, which requires that a `marshmallow.Schema` class be defined for it within its `serialization_schema` classmethod.


## Example:  Shopping Cart Session Management

This is _not_ a primer on how to write your own e-commerce shopping cart application.  This example is intended to illustrate the Session API. **It is not intended for production use.**

As per Wikipedia:

> A shopping cart is a piece of e-commerce software on a web server that allows visitors to an Internet site to select items for eventual purchase... The software allows online shopping customers to _accumulate a list of items for purchase_, described metaphorically as "placing items in the shopping cart" or "add to cart." Upon checkout, the software typically calculates a total for the order, including shipping and handling (i.e., postage and packing) charges and the associated taxes, as applicable.


### Serializing a Shopping Cart in a Session

Let's define our `marshmallow.Schema` classes:

```Python
class ShoppingCartItemSchema(Schema):
    upc = fields.String()
    quantity = fields.Int()

# A shopping_cart is a dict that uses a UPC product code as its key and quantity
# as its value:
class ShoppingCartSchema(Schema):
    items = fields.Nested(ShoppingCartItemSchema, many=True)

# this class is declared in case there are attributes other than a
# shopping cart that need to be serialized:
class SessionAttributesSchema(Schema):
    shopping_cart = fields.Nested(ShoppingCartSchema)
```

Now that you've defined `SessionAttributesSchema`, you are ready to initialize Yosai with shopping-cart enabled session management capabilities.  Simply pass the schema class as an argument at Yosai initialization.  The rest of the arguments passed to init_yosai are omitted for clarity:

```Python

    SecurityUtils.init_yosai(... # omitted for this example
                             ... # omitted for this example
                             session_schema=SessionAttributesSchema)
```


### Shopping Cart

ShoppingCart is a facade to the Session API for managing the shopping_cart attribute within a Session.

A `shopping_cart` is a dict that uses a UPC product code as its key and quantity as its value.

A ShoppingCart allows you to add, update, and removes items and adjust the quantity of each item.

```Python
class ShoppingCart(Serializable):
    def __init__(self, current_user):
        """
        :type current_user: subject_abcs.Subject
        """
        self.current_user = current_user
        self.session = self.current_user.get_session()

    def list_items(self):
        shopping_cart = self.session.get_attribute('shopping_cart')
        return shopping_cart.items()

    def add_item(self, upc, quantity):
        shopping_cart = self.session.get_attribute('shopping_cart')
        shopping_cart[item] = quantity
        session.set_attribute('shopping_cart', shopping_cart)

    def update_item(self, upc, quantity):
        shopping_cart = self.session.get_attribute('shopping_cart')
        shopping_cart[item] = quantity
        session.set_attribute('shopping_cart', shopping_cart)

    def remove_item(self, upc):
        shopping_cart = self.session.get_attribute('shopping_cart')
        shopping_cart.pop(item)
        session.set_attribute('shopping_cart', shopping_cart)
```

!!! note ""
    This class is designed based on the assumption that a new ShoppingCart     instance is obtained per request.  A Session is accessed at **init**.     A Session is validated only when it is accessed.  If ShoppingCart were to be     used in a web application, it would be instantiated _per request_ and     consequently the Session would be validated per-request.


Now, you will see how your interaction with the ShoppingCart API impacts a user's Session.  We'll add four items to the shopping cart, remove one, and modify the quantity of another.  Finally, we'll remove the shopping_cart attribute entirely from the Session.


### Operation 1:  Add four items to the shopping cart

```Python
    from yosai.core import SecurityUtils

    current_user = SecurityUtils.get_subject()
    my_cart = ShoppingCart(current_user)

    my_cart.add_item('0043000200216', 4)  # we'll modify the quantity of this later
    my_cart.add_item('016000119772', 1)
    my_cart.add_item('52159012038', 3)
    my_cart.add_item('00028400028196', 1)

    my_cart.list_items()
```

### Operation 2:  Remove an item from the shopping cart

```Python
    from yosai.core import SecurityUtils

    current_user = SecurityUtils.get_subject()
    my_cart = ShoppingCart(current_user)

    my_cart.remove_item('00028400028196')

     my_cart.list_items()
```

### Operation 3:  Modify the quantity of an item in the shopping cart

```Python
    from yosai.core import SecurityUtils

    current_user = SecurityUtils.get_subject()
    my_cart = ShoppingCart(current_user)

    my_cart.update_item('0043000200216', 2)

    my_cart.list_items()
```

### Operation 4:  Remove the shopping cart attribute from the Session

```Python
    from yosai.core import SecurityUtils

    current_user = SecurityUtils.get_subject()
    session = self.current_user.get_session()
    session.remove_attribute('shopping_cart')
```
